# Project 10: WTWR (What to Wear): Front-End

## Project Description

This React project, combining with the backend expresss project, creates a full-stack application that allows users to add, like, and delete their own clothing items. Users can create an account, log in, and log out of the platform. Additionally, WTWR filters displayed clothing items based on the local weather forecast, helping users choose appropriate attire for the day.

### Production URL

The live version of the application is available at:

**Production URL**: `https://w2w.crabdance.com`

### API Configuration

The front end communicates with the back end via this base API URL:

**API URL**: `https://api.w2w.crabdance.com`

To set this in your environment variables, add the following line to your `.env` file in the front end:

```plaintext
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.w2w.crabdance.com
```

### React + Vite

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
